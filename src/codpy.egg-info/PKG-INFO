# Overview

Codpy is a kernel based, open source software library for high performance numerical computations relying on the [RKHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducingkernel_Hilbert_space) theory. 

It contains a set of core tools that we use for machine Learning, statistics and numerical simulations, see our [introduction to codpy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07084) for a review of the method, as well as several examples running this library.

Please refer to [ReadTheDoc](https://codpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the technical documentation.

**Warning**: codpy versions 0.1.XX are alpha versions in early development stage and will be subject to rapid changes without down compatibilities.


## Technical requirement

This version of the library is multi-core CPU architectures, and is tested on

 * windows / amd64 platforms  

# Installation 

Note: this installation process has been tested on
 * windows / amd64 platform 

## prerequisite

### Minimum installation

* [python3.9.XX](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.7/python-3.9.7-amd64.exe): a valid python python 3.9 installation.

*NOTE* : Python installations differ from one machine to another. The python root folder is denoted "\<path/to/python39>" in the rest of this document. The software [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/), or other finding files tools can be useful locating the file python.exe on windows machine...

### Dev installations

For information, we list the softwares that we are using for our dev configuration :
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org): use any CRAN mirror for download
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com): see the download link, then choose the free version
* [MiKTEX](https://miktex.org): see the download tab
* [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Those installations should be fine using the latest (64 bits) version and the default settings for each software .

*Note* Once R and RStudio are installed, open the latter.
In the console, enter "*install.packages("rmarkdown")*" to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).

## Cloning repo

Download the codpy repo at [codpy alpha](https://github.com/JohnLeM/codpy_alpha) to your location <path/to/codpyrepo>

## Installation

### prerequisite

We suppose that there is a valid python installation on the host machine. The reader can 
* either use its main python environment ```<path/to/python39>```
* or create a virtual python environment ```<path/to/venv>```, generally an advisable practice.

First open a command shell ```cmd```,  create a virtual environment and activate it using the commands

```
python -m venv .\venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
*NOTE* : In the rest of the installation procedure, we consider a virtual environment <path/to/venv>. One can replace with <path/to/python39> if a main environment installation is desired, for dev purposes for instance.

### pip install codpy

Open a command shell ```cmd```, and pip install codpy

```
pip install codpy==0.XX.XX
```
or from the local repository

```
pip install <path/to/codpyrepo>/dist/codpy-XXXX.whl
```
The installation procedure might take some minutes depending on your internet connection.

### Test codpy

open a python shell and import codpy
```
python
```
```
import codpy
```

# Testing with Visual Studio Code

You can your visual studio installation.

 - With Visual Studio Code, open the ```<path/to/codpyrepo>``` folder and select for instance the file  ```<path/to/codpyrepo>/test/1NN_estimation_rate.py```

 - If required, select your python interpreter to the virtual environment one (Shift+P) 

- Hit F5. If everything works, you should have some figures after one or two minutes.
