Welcome to Codpy's documentation!
=================================


Codpy is a kernel based, open source software library relying on the `RKHS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space>`_ theory.

It contains a set of core tools that we use for machine learning, statistics and numerical simulations. 
See our `introduction to codpy <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07084>`_ for more details and several example applications running this library.
